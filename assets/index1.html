            <p>
              My name in Daria. I was born in Siberia (yes it is very cold in
              there, it is about -25-30F in winter). I lived in the north of
              China for awhile, and then went to college in Russian Far East(
              !Fun fact! my school's campus is on an island, and there is
              nothing else besides the campus on this island). I lived in
              Shanghai for about year and a half, and was an exchange student at
              Fudan university. I have a degree in Internation Relations and
              Diplomacy. I moved to US at the end of 2015, and studied Business
              and Accounting in UCLA Extension. Right now I work for an
              accounting firm in Westwood. We do business management,
              accounting, bokkeeping, and taxes. I have amazing co-workers but
              accounting was never my passion so hopefully after the Bootcamp I
              will be able to find a job thta I will be more passionate about.
